If a is a synonym of b and b is a synonym of c, this implies that a is a synonym of c and c is a synonym of a

"advice:counsel counsel:suggestion suggestion:advice activity:briskness briskness:liveliness"
briskness
[liveliness, activity]

In this example, advice, counsel, suggestion are all synonyms of each other, while advice is not a synonym of activity.

Problem: Given an input data in the format above and a word, write a program to find out all the synonyms of that word.


input: string of synonyms, word
string
    input always valid
    no empty string
    always at least 1 pair of words
word
    no empty string
    edge case: word not in synonym string


Convert string of synonyms -> adjacency list -> Loop adjacency list -> DFS from each node if it matches input word. Append to result list.
TC: O(N + M^2), N = Chars in string, M = Unique Words
SC: O(M)
